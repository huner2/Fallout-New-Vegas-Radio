# Fallout-New-Vegas-Radio

A Fallout New Vegas radio bot for Discord.
Audio files are packed into the executable using Packr, therefore, you should expect ~80 MB binaries, and ~80 MB memory usage when running the bot.

# Bot Usage
Fallout-New-Vegas-Radio.exe -t token

!vegas command

Built using Packrv2, you can build with Makefile.bat if you have the Packrv2 binary on Windows.
Same general idea for linux
